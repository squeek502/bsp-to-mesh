bsp-to-mesh
===========

Extremely hacky attempt at converting a Source engine BSP file into something usable by Babylon.JS for [squeek502/bunnyhop-webgl](https://github.com/squeek502/bunnyhop-webgl).

Cobbled together from:
- [Galaco/bsp](https://github.com/Galaco/bsp/)
- [Galaco/lambda-core](https://github.com/Galaco/lambda-core/)

To run:

```
go run . mapname.bsp
```
